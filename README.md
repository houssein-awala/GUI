# GUI
In this academic project, I created a Java swing no code IDE, to create, save and load graphical user interfaces.

This project allows the user to create a graphical user interface for his project using drag and drop methods, and it also supports undo / redo operations.

This project is incomplete, but can be used by students for educational purposes, and is useful for anyone wanting to learn how to organize Java projects, develop undo / redo operations, Java objects serialization, and manage Java swing components.
